    <h2 class="notBold">Background</h2>
    <p>For this project, I got some hands on experience with using user to data to improve a website. We had learned
        about A/B testing specifically, so we created two versions of a website and performed statistical tests to see
        if there was any significant difference in users' clicks.</p>
    <h2 class="notBold">Process</h2>
    <p>I first made some minor changes between the two sites, and I developed hypotheses about which changes would
        increase
        user interaction. After asking individuals to interact with my site, I looked through the data and did tests for
        the time it took them to finish their interactions and the amount that returned to the home page after checking
        out. Neither were effected in a statistically significant way. All the results were recorded in an infographic.
    </p>
    <h2 class="notBold">Takeaways</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Small changes to a site can have a large impact on where users choose to click.</li>
        <li>One should only show a test version of a website to a small portion of users, in order to not have a
            significant impact on sales if the results are negative.</li>
        <li>A/B tests on very small aspects of a website can be done regularly to have a large effect, instead of
            testing one large layout change.</li>
    </ul>
