    <h1 class="notBold">Personas & Storyboarding</h1>
    <h2 class="notBold">Background</h2>
    <p>As my first project for UI/UX, this assignment was very focused on the design process. In class I learned about
        the purpose of personas, and a bit about how they were created. For this project we were tasked with conducting
        interviews regarding an interface of our choice. We then built two personas off of these interviews, and created
        a storyboard to map out the thought process of one of these characters.</p>
    <h2 class="notBold">Process</h2>
    <p>First, I selected a microwave as the interface. Each student had one in their room, so I knew that my
        interviewees would have some experience with it. I then interviewed several friends, who had a variety of
        experiences with the microwave. After conducting the interviews I created my personas,representing two very
        perspectives that incorporated many thoughts from my interviewees. Finally, I built a storyboard using one of
        the created personas.</p>
    <h2 class="notBold">Takeaways</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Personas are a good way to see what a potential user would want, without needing to interact with that type
            of user directly.</li>
        <li>Personas should not be based off of the perspectives of one user, but a combination of ideas that create a
            new, but very plausible, character.</li>
        <li>Storyboards should capture all parts of the character's interaction, in order to catch any details about
            what the user may want in a design.</li>
    </ul>
