    <h1 class="notBold">Iterative Design</h1>
    <h2 class="notBold">Background</h2>
    <p>At this point I had experience in many different aspects of web design. For this assignment, we needed to create
        a website based only off of a product idea. In groups, we were given a list of recent startups. We selected one
        and based on the small description we created a website prototype.</p>
    <h2 class="notBold">Process</h2>
    <p>My group selected Mesh, a startup that offered a unique service that would test our ability to design an
        applicable website. We each sketched a basic idea for the look of the site, and combined the best of these
        sketches into a wireframe. After turning our wireframe into a prototype, we asked for critiques from peers and
        an industry professional, and used this information to improve.</p>
    <h2 class="notBold">Takeaways</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Labels should match the users' mental models as closely as possible, to ensure that they know the purpose of
            each page.</li>
        <li>Features like breadcrumb trails are very useful to let users return after making an error, and show them the
            path that lead to the current page.</li>
        <li>Simple color schemes are best, to prevent poor contrast and to give the site a clear theme.</li>
    </ul>
