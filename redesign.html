    <h1 class="notBold">Responsive Redesign</h1>
    <h2 class="notBold">Background</h2>
    <p>Now that I had a bit of experience with web design, this project tasked us with improving an already existing
        website. We first assessed the design problems and accessibility flaws with the original website. We then went
        through the stages of the iterative design process, in order to create the new and improved version.</p>
    <h2 class="notBold">Process</h2>
    <p>I selected a local website from my hometown. It was riddled with accessibility issues, so my wireframe worked to
        address these. As I worked more on my wireframes and prototypes, I also noticed many issues with the font
        hierarchy and color scheme. I sought to improve these for my final design which was much simpler without all of
        the distractions of the original, but much more elegant.</p>
    <h2 class="notBold">Takeaways</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Color scheme is very important for accessibility, and to give a website a unifying theme.</li>
        <li>Images that constantly move on a website can be very distracting for the user.</li>
        <li>Simplicity is often better in web design, to give the user a clear indication of where the should look.</li>
    </ul>
